 #actor problems

 1. no oneway funcs (can't call from synchronous code)
 2. can't selectively block callers (to pass a continuation to an actor requires spawning a task which gives up ordering guarantees)
 3. can't block calling tasks on internal state (can only block with async call to another task)
 4. no concept of cancellation (cannot perform orderly shutdown with outstanding requests in flight)
 5. execute on global actor queues (generally not needed or desirable)
 6. No way of possible failure to enqueue on an overburdened actor, all requests enter an unbounded queue

 #actor solutions: StateTask - a swift implementation of the Haskell ST monad

 1. LOCK FREE CHANNELS
 2. Haskell translation: âˆ€s in Rank-N types becomes a Task
 3. Use explicit queues to process events

 # statetask action requirements:

 2. sendable funcs
 3. routable
 4. value types
 5. some actions are blocking, these need special handling (think DO oneway keyword)

 From: [SE-304 Structured Concurrency](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0304-structured-concurrency.md#structured-concurrency-1)
 > Systems that rely on queues are often susceptible to queue-flooding, where the queue accepts more work than it can actually handle. This is typically solved by introducing "back-pressure": a queue stops accepting new work, and the systems that are trying to enqueue work there respond by themselves stopping accepting new work. Actor systems often subvert this because it is difficult at the scheduler level to refuse to add work to an actor's queue, since doing so can permanently destabilize the system by leaking resources or otherwise preventing operations from completing. Structured concurrency offers a limited, cooperative solution by allowing systems to communicate up the task hierarchy that they are coming under distress, potentially allowing parent tasks to stop or slow the creation of presumably-similar new work.

 We address this by having the reducer explicitly dispose of any unprocessed queued items.
