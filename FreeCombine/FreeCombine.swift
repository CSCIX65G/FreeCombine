 There must also be a function which satisfies a Request
 by consuming a Publication.  We call such a function
 a Subscriber.  In a very human manner a Subscriber
 consuming a publication can cause even more Demand
 which it provides as its return type.
 
 This form means that you can compose Subscribers
 with Producers.  Since you only get the Subscriber
 AFTER you have a producer, the composition must be a
 `contraMap` or `contraFlatMap` (i.e. you prepend the
 Producer to the Subscriber). `contraMap`ping a
 Subscriber with a Producer yields a function
 from Request to Demand as you can verify:

     (Producer >>> Subscriber) -> (Request) -> Demand

 erasing the Publication type in the process.

 A Subscription is a function which is its own independent source
 of Demand, so it doesn't care about the demand returned from
 a Subscriber.  Hence a Subscription is a function
