 two other types, you expect it to have two
 map functions (and it does, in another file).

/*:
 These are our 2 basic types.  Everything we do in this package
 is simply writing functions that manipulate supply and demand instances.
 Best of all, the manipulations that we want to do themselves
 come in only 4 basic types of functions which can then be composed
 using only 3 of the 5 standard functions on Func.
 So you _must_ understand how those function-returning-functions
 do their work.
 
 So diving into our function types...
 
 Ultimately, there must be a function which produces a Supply
 in response to a Demand.  We call such a function a Producer.
 */

    public let call: (Demand) -> Supply<Value, Failure>
    public init(_ call: @escaping (Demand) -> Supply<Value, Failure>) {
        self.call = call
    }
}

/*:
 Since we have a function which can produce Supply in
 response to Demand, there must also be a function which
 consumes a Supply to satisfy a Demand.  We call
 such a function a Subscriber because it will not consume
 just one supply, but an entire series of them if supply
 is available.
 
 In a very human manner a Subscriber consuming some Supply
 can induce even more Demand which it provides as its function
 return type.
 
 This way of describing the combination of producing
 and subscribing means that you can compose Subscribers
 with Producers. This should be very intuitive since it is
 how all of economics actually works as well.
 
 But... You can only form a Subscriber AFTER you have a Producer,
 so the composition of the two functions must be a `contraMap`
 or `contraFlatMap` (i.e. you prepend the Producer to the Subscriber).
 In particular, since we can produce Supply in batches, we are
 going to want to use `contraFlatMap`, which means that
 we are going to need at least a `join` function on
 Subscriber as well.
 
 This last point is _very_ important to understand, it reveals
 a huge amount about what `contraFlatMap` actually _means_
 
 `contraFlatMap`ping a Subscriber with a Producer yields a
 function from Demand to Demand as you can verify:

     (Subscriber.contraFlatMap(Producer)) -> (Demand) -> Demand

 Note that this operation erases the Supply type in the process.

        self.call = call
    }
}
/*:
 A Subscription is a function which is its own independent source
 of Demand, so it doesn't care about the demand returned from
 a Subscriber.  Hence a Subscription is a function
 (Demand) -> Void which can be derived as follows:
 
     (Subscriber.contraFlatMap(Producer)).map(void)
 
 erasing the Demand return type in the process.  The second
 `init` below allows us to go straight from:
 `(Subscriber.contraFlatMap(Producer))` to `Subscription` in
 this manner

/*:
 Finally, we need some way of taking a Producer and a
 Subscriber and creating a Subscription.
 
 A Publisher is a curried function which combines a Producer
 and a Subscriber to yield a Subscription in the manner
 shown above.  I.e. it has the form:
 
     (Producer) -> (Subscriber) -> Subscription

 It can be initialized with a Producer (a separate init below)
 or with a function (Subscriber) -> Subscription
 where the Producer has already been partially
 applied to the function.
 
 And as always, because Publisher is parameterized by multiple
 generic types, it too, has multiple forms of map.  Indeed
 it has a lot of functionality which
 allows us to chain Publishers together in all sorts of
 interesting ways.
 
 The majority of this library is given over to chaining
 Publishers in fact.

/*:
 All of FreeCombine is implemented as composition of the 2 basic value types
 using the 4 basic function types.  To reiterate, the value types are:
 
     Demand
     Supply (which as a genereric has map functions on it)
 
 and the function types (all represented as "call-as-function"
 Swift structs) are:
 
     Producer: (Demand) -> Supply
     Subscriber: (Supply) -> Demand
     Subscription: (Demand) -> Void
     Publisher: (Producer) -> (Subscriber) -> Subscription
 
 and we "combine" these elements using the basic functional
 programming elements of:
 
     map
     contraFlatMap
     dimap
 
 which are all the functions we defined on our Func struct.

 
 ### More explanation
 
 To do anything we need to connect our Producer type to our
 Subscriber type.  Subscriber is a function:
 
     (Supply) -> Demand
 
 Producer is a function:
    
     (Demand) -> Supply
 
 Clearly the two functions compose, the question is which way?
 Do I want to end up with a function of (Demand) -> Demand
 or of (Supply) -> Supply.
 
 In this, as in economics, Demand precedes Supply, so
 we want to prepend our Producer function to our Subscriber
 function. Prepending says immediately that we will need
 to contraMap the Producer function onto the Subscriber
 function.
 
 There's one added wrinkle: we want to repeatedly
 call producer, feeding its output to the subscriber until
 either the producer can't produce anymore or the subscriber
 responds with no further demand.  Making multiple calls
 is precisely why `contraFlatMap` exists.
 
 Look closely at the signature of `contraFlatMap`
 
     func contraFlatMap<C>(
         _ join:  @escaping (Self) -> Self,
         _ transform:@escaping (C) -> A
     ) -> Func<C, B>
 
 That join at the beginning is a little weird. `contraFlatMap`
 allows us to wrap the subscriber function in another
 function of the same signature which calls the inner
 function as many times as necessary to deliver the values.
 This is precisely what we want.
 
 We will form an outer `join` function which when given
 an initial value will repeatedly call the producer
 and subscriber functions until one of them is exhausted.
 
 Here's what such a join function looks like.
 */
extension Subscriber {
    static func producerJoin(
        _ producer: Producer<Value, Failure>
    ) -> (Self) -> Self {
        let demandRef = Reference<Demand>(.max(1))
        return { downstreamSubscriber in
            return .init { supply in
                demandRef.value = downstreamSubscriber(supply)
                while demandRef.value.quantity > 0 {
                    let nextSupply = producer(demandRef.value)
                    switch nextSupply {
                    case .none:
                        return demandRef.value
                    case .value, .failure:
                        demandRef.value = downstreamSubscriber(nextSupply)
                    case .finished:
                        return downstreamSubscriber(nextSupply)
                    }
                }
                return demandRef.value
            }
        }
    }
}
/*:
 Note that the inner function is kicked off with a Supply.
 This supply is then provided to the downstreamSubscriber
 to obtain more demand.  If there is positive demand,
 we ask the producer for more supply. If there is any,
 we in turn feed the supply to the downstream.  Lather,
 rinse, repeat until one is exhausted.
 
 Now we can call `contraFlatMap` on the subscriber, rolling
 the producer up in our join function (remember the signature):

     func contraFlatMap<Demand>(
         _ join:  @escaping ((Supply) -> Demand) -> ((Supply) -> Demand),
         _ transform:@escaping (Demand) -> Supply
     ) -> Func<Demand, Demand>


 and passing the producer itself as the transform function.
 
 That one line produces a function (Subscriber) -> Subscription
 that when kicked with a demand will repeatedly call the producer
 and subscriber until one of them is exhausted
 */
extension Publisher {
    init(_ producer: Producer<Output, Failure>) {
        self.call = { subscriber in
            .init(subscriber.contraFlatMap(Subscriber.producerJoin(producer), producer.call))
        }
    }
}
