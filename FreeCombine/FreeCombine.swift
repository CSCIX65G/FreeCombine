 two other types, you expect it to have two
 map functions (and it does, in another file).

/*:
 The are our 3 basic types.  Everything we do in this package
 is simply writing functions that manipulate these types.
 Best of all the manipulations that we want to do themselves
 come in 3 basic types of functions which can then be composed
 using the 5 stand functions on Func.  So you _must_ understand
 how those function-returning-functions do.
 
 So diving into our function types...
 
 Ultimately, there must be a function which produces a Publication
 in response to a Request.  We call such a function a Producer.
 
 Like all the functions we will discuss which are parameterized
 by multiple generic types, producers have a family of interesting
 map functions, which we will explore in detail elsewhere in
 the library.
*/
public struct Producer<Value, Failure: Error> {
    public let call: (Request) -> Publication<Value, Failure>
    public init(_ call: @escaping (Request) -> Publication<Value, Failure>) {
        self.call = call
    }
}

/*:
 Since we have a function which can produce Publications in
 response to requests, there must also be a function which
 satisfies a Request by consuming a Publication.  We call
 such a function a Subscriber.
 
 In a very human manner a Subscriber consuming a publication
 can induce even more Demand which it provides as its function
 return type.
 
 This division of production and consumption means
 that you can compose Subscribers with Producers.
 This should be very intuitive since it is how all
 of economics actually works as well.
 
 But... You only get the Subscriber AFTER you have a producer,
 so the composition of the two functions must be a `contraMap`
 or `contraFlatMap` (i.e. you prepend the Producer to the Subscriber).
 In particular, since we can produce Publications in batches, we are
 going to want to use `contraFlatMap`, which means that
 we are going to need at least a `join` function on
 Subscriber as well.
 
 `contraFlatMap`ping a Subscriber with a Producer yields a
 function from Request to Demand as you can verify:

     (Producer >>> Subscriber) -> (Request) -> Demand

 (I use >>> here imprecisely since I haven't written an
 operator for `contraFlatMap` in the `join` form). Note that
 this operation erases the Publication type in the process.
 
 Also note that since Subscriber has two generic parameters
 like Publication, you expect it to have multiple forms
 of map, flatMap, contraMap and contraFlatMap. (And
 since we will need them it actually does, in another file).

        self.call = call
    }
}

/*:
 A Subscription is a function which is its own independent source
 of Demand, so it doesn't care about the demand returned from
 a Subscriber.  Hence a Subscription is a function
 (Request) -> Void which can be derived as follows:
 
     (Producer >>> Subscriber).map(void)
 
 erasing the Demand type in the process.  The second
 `init` below allows us to go straight from:
 `(Producer >>> Subscriber)` to `Subscription` in
 this manner

        self.init(f.map(void).call)
    }
}

/*:
 Finally, we need some way of taking a Producer and a
 Subscriber and creating a Subscription.
 
 A Publisher is a curried function which combines a Producer
 and a Subscriber to yield a Subscription in the manner
 shown above.  I.e. it has the form:
 
     (Producer) -> (Subscriber) -> Subscription

 It can be initialized with a Producer (the first init below)
 or with a function (Subscriber) -> Subscription (the second
 init below) where the Producer has already been partially
 applied to the function.
 
 And as always, because Publisher is parameterized by multiple
 generic types, it too, has multiple forms of map.  Indeed
 it has a generalized form of monadic functionality which
 allow us to chain Publishers together in all sorts of
 interesting ways.
 
 The majority of this library is given over to chaining
 Publishers in fact.

 All of FreeCombine is implemented as composition of the 3 basic value types
 using the 4 basic function types.  To reiterate, the value types are:
 
     Demand
     Request
     Publication
 
 and the function types (all represented as "call-as-function"
 Swift structs) are:
 
     Producer: (Request) -> Publication
     Subscriber: (Publication) -> Demand
     Subscription: (Request) -> Void
     Publisher: (Producer) -> (Subscriber) -> Subscription
 
 and we "combine" these elements using the basic functional
 programming elements of:
 
     map
     flatMap
     contraMap
     contraFlatMap
     dimap
