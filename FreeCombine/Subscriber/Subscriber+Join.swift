     Wrapping a producer in a subscriber
     in such a way that the new subscriber, will now
     accept Requests for invocation.  On
     invocation the new subscriber will:
     
     1. forward the request to the producer
     2. iterate over the producer as long as a) the producer can
        produce and b) the original subscriber returns additional
        demand.
